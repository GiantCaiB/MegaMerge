## Assumptions
1. We only have barcode, catalog and supplier, but if we want to extend this, it will not be a good place to add new types of source.
2. All catalog and suppliers are presented in barcode input file
## ToDo
1. Replace the DataRepository with proper and different database repositories for different entities.
2. More unit tests.
3. Merge 3 ConsumeServices into 1 generic service.
